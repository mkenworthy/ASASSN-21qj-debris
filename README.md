The otherwise unremarkable G type star ASASSN-21qj (T=5900 K) started undergoing a complex eclipse in 2021, announced in [Rizzo Smith+ (2021)](https://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=14879) which has been followed with photometric monitoring in the optical by several observatories. The photometry suggests sub-micron sized dust is responsible for the eclipse, which has a duration of at least 500 days. This paper suggests a hypothesis for the generation of the dust and its subsequent evolution with time.
